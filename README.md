## Introduction 
This is a set of eight tutorials on the structure, function and interaction of biomolecules with some important receptors for distance laerning using the Google Colab. In addition, this series of tutorials tutorials highlight and make visible the value-added biomolecules present in Colombia's plant biodiversity.

These tutorials were created between February to August 2023 as part of the  open repository project for cloud-based hands-on computer labs for STEM education. Each tutorial was developed for use in a 16-week undergraduate course called molecular biology within the Department of Biological Sciences, and in a graduate course titled artificial intelligence in biocatalysis as part of the Master' program in Biological Sciences and the undergraduate programme in chemical and food engineering at Universidad de los Andes.

The tutorials integrated into the courses consist of four main sections. The initial section provides an introduction that highlights the significance of the molecule and its prevalence in Colombia’s biodiversity. The second section focuses on the characterization of the chemical structure of the molecule of interest. This is followed by a detailed description of the receptor to which the molecule binds, including the individual components of its structure. The final section features an activity designed to reinforce the learning acquired from the tutorial by applying it to another molecule that interacts with the same receptor as the studied molecule.

## Description of the tutorials

The following is a brief of each tutorial, along with the receptor used for each biomolecule.
